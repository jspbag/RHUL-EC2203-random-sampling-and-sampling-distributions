<!-- ## Statistics -->

<!-- - Probability theory provide us with concepts that allow us to describe and analyze situations involving randomness -->

<!--   For example, the mean and variance of a random variable -->

<!-- - Probability theory does not tell us how to **quantify**, say, the mean and variance of a random variable. -->

<!--   For that, we need statistics  -->

# Random sampling

## Population and sample

- The **population** is the entire pool from which a statistical sample is drawn (people, firms, objects, events, etc.)

  For example, all EC2203 students if we are interested in learning about the distribution of EC2203 marks

- The **sample** is a subset of the population

  For example, 20 of the EC2203 students in the population

- Statistics and econometrics deal with what we can learn about the population from a sample

## Simple random sampling

- Suppose we are interested in the random variable $Y$ with distribution $f_Y(y)$

  For example, $Y$ could represent the eventual EC2203 mark

- Sample $n$ objects (e.g. EC2203 students) selected **at random** from the population (e.g all EC2203 students); 

  then, record the value of $Y$ for each member of the sample (i.e. the EC2203 mark for each sampled student)

  $$\{Y_i; i=1,...,n\}$$

- Random sampling means that each population-member is **equally likely to be included**


## A random sample

- The sample $\{Y_i; i=1,...,n\}$ is obtained by sampling $Y$, a **single** random variable,  **$n$ times**

- A different set of $Y$-values will be recorded if we redo the random sampling: useful to treat the sample as a **collection of $n$ random variables**

<!-- - The adjective **random** in "random sample" refers to the way the sample is obtained, not the realized sample -->

## i.i.d. sample

- Because $\{Y_i; i=1,...,n\}$ is drawn at random from the same population, the $Y_i$'s are **identically distributed**

  $$f_{Y_i}(y) = f_{Y}(y); \quad i=1,2,...,n$$ 
  
- Under simple random sampling, the $Y_i$'s are **independent**: knowning $Y_i$ provides no information on $Y_j$ for $j \neq i$

- We say that simple random sampling produces an **independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample**

# Sampling distributions

## The sample average and its distribution

<!-- - All the econometric procedures we consider in EC2203 involves taking (weighted) averages of sampled data -->

- The **simple sample average** is

  $$\overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$$

- Because $\{Y_i; i=1,...,n\}$ is a collection of random variables, $\overline{Y}$ is also a random variable

- The distribution of $\overline{Y}$, induced by random sampling, is denoted the **sampling distribution**

## The mean and variance of the sample average

<div class="box">
Let $\{Y_i; i=1,...,n\}$ be an i.i.d. sample, and consider the sample average $\overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$. Then,

$$\mathrm{E}(\overline{Y}) = \mu_Y; \quad \mathrm{var}(\overline{Y}) = \frac{1}{n}\sigma^2_Y$$

We sometimes denote $\mathrm{var}(\overline{Y})$ by $\sigma^2_\overline{Y}$.

# Summary

- Random sampling

  - Sample viewed as a collection of random variables

  - Simple random sampling produces an i.i.d. sample 

- Sampling distributions

  - Random sampling induces a probability distribution on any statistics computed on the sample
